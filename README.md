# Apache Royale&trade;
[![Build Status](https://builds.apache.org/job/Royale-asjs/lastSuccessfulBuild/badge/icon)](https://builds.apache.org/job/Royale-asjs/)

The Apache Royale project is developing a next-generation of the Apache Flex&trade; SDK: . Royale has the goal of allowing applications developed in MXML and ActionScript to not only run in the Flash/AIR runtimes, but also to run natively in the browser without Flash, on mobile devices as a PhoneGap/Cordova application, and in embedded JS environments such as Chromium Embedded Framework. Royale has the potential to allow your MXML and ActionScript code to run in even more places than Flash currently does.

 # Simple(jsonly)

Simple(jsonly) is like a fork of Apache Royle, but that is not the intention. The "fork" was made because of some extension to the Royale Core project that might make it incompatible with the main Royale repository. The packages included with Simple(jsonly) were selected merely to support examples (such as the WeatherExample which uses the Network package) and to avoid unnecessary duplication.
